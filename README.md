Genome Data
===========

Standardized genomic datasets for selected model organisms

## Generic Sample Data ##

Provide scripts and sample data for developing training/testing sets for some common eukaryotic genomes. The sample data includes approximately 1% of each genome. Data formats are FASTA and GFF3. 

Genomes include:

+ Invertebrates
  + Caenorhabditis elegans
  + Drosophila melanogaster
+ Vertebrates
  + Danio rerio
  + Homo sapiens
  + Mus musculus
+ Plants
  + Arabidopsis thaliana
  + Oryza sativa
+ Fungi
  + Saccharomyces cereviseae
  + Schizosaccharomyces pompe

## Related Works ##

Most of the scripts rely on the KorfLab grimoire library.

Full data sets comprising entire genomes are located _elsewhere_ (but where?)
