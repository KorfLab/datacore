Data Core
=========

Standardized data generation scripts and data sets supporting research efforts
in the Korf Lab.

## Eukaryotic Model Organism Genomic Data ##

Intent: scripts and sample data for developing training/testing sets for some
common eukaryotic genomes. The sample data includes approximately 1% of each
genome. Data formats are FASTA and GFF3. 

Genomes include:

+ Invertebrates
  + Caenorhabditis elegans - 1% from the start of each chromosome
  + Drosophila melanogaster - 1% from the start of each chromosome
+ Vertebrates
  + Danio rerio
  + Homo sapiens - some parts of the human genome
  + Mus musculus
+ Plants
  + Arabidopsis thaliana - 1% from the start of each chromosome
  + Oryza sativa
+ Fungi
  + Saccharomyces cereviseae
  + Schizosaccharomyces pompe
